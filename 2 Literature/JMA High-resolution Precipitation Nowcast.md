Nowcasting is a short-term weather forecast, generally for the next few hours. Starting from 2014, JMA has provided High-resolution Precipitation Nowcast to the general public in Japan in real-time. It has 250 m resolution up to 30 min, and 1 km resolution up to 60 min. Nowcast complements numerical weather prediction (NWP), which is better at longer time scale (1 hour or greater) prediction.
