One of the difficulties in predicting precipitation pattern using deep learning models lies in the scarcity of precipitation; more than 90% of the data is area without precipitation.
The occurrence of heavy precipitations that could lead to societal damage or disruption is much more scarce.

We propose to utilize a deep learning-based “sampler”.

The procedure is also called importance sampling.
Peng et al. (2019) is similar approach.
