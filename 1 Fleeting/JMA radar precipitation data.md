Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) radar precipitation product is a composite of observations at 20 radar stations by C-band Doppler radar. This product covers the entirety of the region of Japan and has a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 5 min.

The methodology for generating these data is described in Nagata (2011). The accuracy of the estimated precipitation in terms of heavy precipitation is evaluated in Shakti et al. (2016).
