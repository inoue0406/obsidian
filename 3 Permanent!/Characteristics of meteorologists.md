Meteorologists understand meteorological phenomena that span across multiple spatial-temporal scales, such as tornadoes, downbursts, cumulus clouds, typhoons, and low-pressure systems.

Meteorologists discover physical laws in nature, often represented as mathematical equations, through mutual communication. The laws they have discovered can then be shared with other researchers in a highly compressed format, such as academic papers and simulation programs.

Meteorologists actively seek out novel phenomena to uncover, perform on-site observations, and reconstruct the events using numerical simulations. Through these curiosity-driven activities, they effectively discover new meteorological laws.
